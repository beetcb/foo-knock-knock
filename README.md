**An Android application that can listen for app notifications/calls and provide timely alerts**

**Principle:** Upon receiving a notification -> Upload to Cloud Log(lik [CLS](https://www.tencentcloud.com/products/cls)) -> The monitoring task regularly checks the time of the last received notification and the last read time -> If it is determined to be unread, it will repeatedly trigger alerts for calls and messages.
